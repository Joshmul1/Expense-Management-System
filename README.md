# Expense Management System

# How to use it?

* Open the 'Instructions' folder and open any 'install_instructions' file       either .md .txt or .pdf and follow the instructions

When the server is running the application can be accessed from
[localhost:8000](localhost:8000)

The default user for testing is:

-  Username : test
-  Password : password

Two other accounts have been created for each marker, however the data you will access is the same

- Username : Martin
- Password : Goodfellow

And

- Username : John
- Password : Levine

If there are any issues with installation and setup please get in contact with myself : joshua.mulheron.2016@uni.strath.ac.uk
